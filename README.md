# Smart-Vehicle-System

Objective

Driving a car has now become a major issue in modern congested cities of today. There simply are too many vehicles on the road. This has led to the need for efficient reverse car parking management systems to avoid fatal accidents. Thus, we demonstrate the use of IoT based reverse car reversing management system that allows for efficient parking technology. This car reversing assistant can protect your car from any damage while reverse parking. It indicates the distance of car from any object. Currently, the IT applications in our daily life are blooming, and there is also a growing trend in the applications of smart cities which can help in improving to reduce smart cities issues. In Smart City we faces many difficulties while developing, to solve smart city issues we have to develop such system which is combination of the new technology also of low cost and based on the different network combination of the Internet, such as a telecommunications, broadcast, wireless and sensor networks where Internet of Things (IoT) is base technology. One of the major issues in a smart city is the safe driving. Using IoT, Smart City can be established by integrating these features for IoT development. IoT uses devices which are connected to each other and systems to collect the data by using embedding sensors, actuators and other physical objects. 

We use Ethernet for internet connectivity and a raspberry pi for operating the system. We use connectivity and IOT management GUI design. The system detects if obstacles are present using Ultrasonic sensors. Also, it uses Adafruit to control components of vehicle. Here we use IOT to control the AC in the car. The AC is connected to Adafruit. Further this Adafruit dashboard is connected to your google assistant through IFTTT platform. Here many applets can be created to control various vehicle systems, AC in this case. Thus, the system solves the problem of reversing the vehicle and also make it possible to control systems in the vehicle using IOT.

Business Scenario

Enabling a sustainable mobility is one of primary goals of the so-called Safe City vision, and the development of intelligent car reversing systems represents a key aspect. To this purpose, we present a Smart Vehicle System based on the jointly use of different technologies, such as IOT, Cloud, and mobile networking. It is able to collect, in real time, both environmental parameters and information about the occupancy state in reverse parking. A customized software application, installed on a cloud platform, is able to manage components inside vehicle (e.g. AC). In such a case, it promptly informs the vehicle through an Internet application, which can be designed and used suitably for the considered scenario.

Problem Statement

In todayâ€™s world where everything is being smart the need arises to include your day to day requirements into the smart technology which can be achieved using iot. When vehicles are being reversed many times there are problems regarding the speed of the vehicle, any unwanted object approaching or pedestrians coming between the roads, which can cause fatal accidents as well. To avoid these inaccuracies we develop the smart technology which can help us park or reverse our vehicles efficiently. 


Result

The result of the system is that while reversing if there is an obstacle in the way the sensor will sense it and notify us while giving also giving the range. Through IOT we can control the components in the vehicle     even though we are far away from the actual vehicle.

Conclusion

In the urban cities, mainly people face problems like traffic congestion, this system allows the drivers to safely drive their vehicles anywhere they want to. Using sensors in a smart vehicle system it helps in   reduction of damage occurring to vehicle, it reduces traffic congestion     in cities. Also, by using IOT in it, our day to day life gets easier.
